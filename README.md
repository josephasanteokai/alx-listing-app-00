# ALX Listing App

## 📝 Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is the foundational stage of an Airbnb clone. The goal of this milestone is to scaffold a modern, scalable, and responsive web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**. This initial setup lays the groundwork for building a dynamic property listing page with clean architecture and reusable components.
